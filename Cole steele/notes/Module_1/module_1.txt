// OBJECTIVES: 
// 1. Evaluate JS using the chrome console
// 2. The 5 primitive data types
// 3. Define variables with the "var" keyword 
// 4. Using 3 inbuilt JS Method (console.log, alert, prompt, var.lenght)


/**
 * 1. Evaluate JS using the chrome console
 * The console is used to check things out or interact with
 *  the browser before implementing it in the Javascript file 
*/

/**
 * 2. The 5 primitive (low-level) data types
 * - Introduction of the 5 Primitive data types
 * - Working with numbers and numeric operators 
 * - Working with strings and common string methods  
*/

/*NUMBERS*/
// NUMBERS - JS does not diffrentiate the numbers into floats, int, etc
// They are just basically numbers
4
9.3
-10

// You can do basic maths operators like +, -, *, /, %.
// It uses the BODMAS METHOD (All program does when it comes to math operations)

/*STRINGS*/
// STRING - They are text they must be inside of double Quote ("") or ('')

"Hello World" // This is 1 string
"43" // This is another string. NOTE: It is not a number 

// Single quotes or double quotes are okay
"Hello world" //prints Hello world
'Hello world' //prints Hello world
"I can't stop eating candy" // This is valid  but this is 
// not valid 'I can't stop eating candy'

// Concatenation - joinig of strings together 
"Seyi" + "Odediran"  //prints SeyiOdediran

// Escape character - they are use to add quotes into a string
// Using a backslash "\" 
// SYNTAX==> "\"YOUR TEXT IN QUOTES GOES HERE!\" "
"Singing \"Do wah diddy, dum diddy do\" " 
// prints out Singing "Do wah diddy, dum diddy do"
"To see a backslash: \\"

// Lenght property - To count the number of letters in a string. It includes space also
// SYNTAX ==> String.length

console.log("Hello world".length)  // gives 11

// Index property - Gives out the character corresponding to index [num]
// NOTE: Counting starts at "0". It includes space also
// SYNTAX ==> String[0]
"hello"[0] // prints out "h"
"hello"[3] // prints out "l"


/*BOOLEANS*/
// BOOLEANS - either TRUE or FALSE

// NULL AND UNDEFINED - They are values, There is only one null and 
// one undefined 


/**
 * 3. Define variables with the "var" keyword
 * VARIBLES are containers 
 * SYNTAX => var variableName = yourValue;
 * you can store all the data types in a variable
 * dynamic typing - they can change to any data types
*/


/**
 * 4. Using 3 inbuilt JS Method (console.log, alert, prompt)
 * clear() - clears console 
 * They 
*/

// alert() -- pops up message to the user . It can take maths operations also
// console.log() -- prints out to the console
// prompt() -- recives from the user 

var userName = prompt("Please enter your name:");
alert("Welcome, " + userName);
console.log("Happy to meet you " + userName);
